We use visible satellite remote sensing and optics to address questions related to phytoplankton ecology and physiology, primary productivity, carbon cycling, biogeochemistry, and physical drivers of biological variability in marine and freshwater systems.  We are particularly interested in the ecological and physiological response of phytoplankton to climate change and the role that community structure plays in carbon cycling and ecosystem functioning.  These interests are investigated through the combination of remotely sensed imagery, in situ data sets and collaboration with biogeochemical numerical modelers.  Our work encompasses a variety of spatial scales ranging from single lakes to the global ocean.
